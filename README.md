# Soap ðŸ§¼ - An app cleaner cli for macOS

> I was so lazy to use any GUI to clean my macOS. - @kud

A simple command in your shell to remove the application you want to delete and the related files as well (like preferences, logs, `.dmg`, cask formula).

## Motivation

I used to use AppCleaner and [App Eraser](https://github.com/davunt/app-eraser) but the first one is not open source (and could have trackers) and the second one is not a CLI but a GUI. Here comes _soap_.

## Install

```shell
npm install -g @kud/soap-cli
```

## Usage

You've got two ways to uninstall an application, via its path or via its cask name.

#### Application path

```shell
soap <app-path>
# ex: soap '/Applications/Android Studio.app'
```

_warning: it won't remove the cask formula even if you've installed the app via homebrew._

#### Cask name

```shell
soap <cask-name>
# ex: soap android-studio
```

It will delete for instance this kind of files:

```
/Applications/Android Studio.app
/Users/kud/Downloads/android-studio-ide-182.5314842-mac.dmg
/Users/kud/Library/Preferences/com.google.android.studio.plist
/Users/kud/Library/Saved Application State/com.google.android.studio.savedState
/Users/kud/Library/Application Support/google/AndroidStudio4.2
/Users/kud/Library/Caches/google/AndroidStudio4.2
/Users/kud/Library/Logs/google/AndroidStudio4.2
```

No worries, soap will move them into your Trash, so if something wrong has happened, you can check there your files.
